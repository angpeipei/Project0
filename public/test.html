Design a responsive css menu without javascript using pure HTML5 and CSS3.  This how to tutorial video will cover creating a responsive menu system that doesn't rely on Javascript & is also accessible.  It will respond to mobile & tablet breakpoints and uses a mobile first menu approach.  There is some fun css animations for the responsive hamburger menu as well.  Below are the starting files along with other mentioned resources:

Amazing tutorial Sir. I searched for responsive navbar tutorial and all the ones I found were either with javascript or extremely hard to understand for a beginner like me. Thanks to god I found this tutorial. Sir, no one, no one in entire youtube has explained this concept of hamburger menu with only css, so beautifully and so clearly step by step in a manner that even a beginner can understand. While following you, I had literally smiled looking at the output and also because now I understand the background functionality of how actually this works because of checkbox. You have mastered the core concepts and helped us master too. You were hand-holding your viewers throughout and explained every logic so beautifully.


Oh my god! To have mentors like you is a blessing. I am extremely extremely extremely thankful to you Sir for making such tutorials.
Respect to you and god bless you Sir.

Thanks for the tutorial. It's really helpful. I have a question. I want the menu to collapse
 back up(max-height to get back to zero) once I click on a menu-item. Can we achieve this with CSS?

A very helpful video indeed! Thank you so much. Though, I was wondering how we could add some content below the header element and make it move down when the hamburger menu is opened.

15:20 Estou implementando seu código no meu projeto, porém quando chego nessa parte o fundo do header some, mas os links do menu continuam visiveis. Sabe o que possa ser? Um abraço do Brasil
